### Summary

Automated Image Colorization using pre-trained EfficientNet and Color Rebalancing.

This project is to solve a real-world problem, which aims to recover the colorized images from monochrome (black-and-white) ones. By leveraging deep learning techniques, it's now possible to generate some fantasic colored images from grayscale ones.
